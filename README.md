Data
The exercise assigned to   this week are based on   the   General   Social   Survey(GSS).You   can download the"GSS2013_shortened.sav"data   file   from   the   course   website   on   Quercus(go   to   "Tutorials">"Datasets").
Exercise   1 (90%of mark)
The research question you will   be   investigating this week   is: Does the average   number   of   friends differ between men   and women?
a) For   this   exercise,you   are   going   to   create   a   new   variable   capturing   respondents'number   of   friends   based   on   the"Number   of   Close   friends   [scf_100c]"and   the"Number   of   other   friends   [scf_110c]").Generate   the   new variable   by   adding   two   existing variables following   the   instructions   in   the   tutorial.Check vour work:Calculate   basic   descriptive   statistics(mean,standard   deviation, minimum   and   maximum).What   is   the   lowest   and what   is   the   highest   number   of friends? What   is the average   number of friends?Do these values   look   plausible?
b) Calculate   the   mean   number   of   friends   for   women   and   men.Instruction:Go   to   Analyze>
Compare    Means>Means..>move    the    variable"Number of friends"into the box   "Dependent   List"and   the    variable"Sex    of   respondent"(sex)into    the    "Layer    1    of1"box>
click   on   OK.Include   this   descriptive   table   in   your   report.
●    write   a   sentence   of   interpretation   about   how   these   sample   means   compare
●   explain why we   need to   conduct   a two-sample significance   test   when   we   can   tell   whether there is a difference   just by examining the two   means   in   the   table
c)       Following the instructions in the SPSS   DEMONSTRATION   11.2(p.381),produce   an
error bar graph comparing women and   men's average   number of friends.Interpret   the graph the point estimates and confidence   intervals,separately   (one   sentence each).Then,interpret   both   of the   graphs   together(one   sentence   only).(That's   three      sentences   in   total:One for   men,one for women,and   one for   both   of   them   together)
Next,you   are   going   to   conduct   a two-sided two-sample test for means at the.05   significance   level.
d) State the hypotheses mathematically and literally.
e) Perform. a two-sample means test using    Demonstration   11.3(p.382). In order       to               conduct   this   hypothesis   test,you   need   to   know   what   the   numerical   values   are   that      are    assigned to the categories    "male"and"female"on the variable sex.To find    this   out,consult the GSS CODE   BOOK.
f) State whether you   reject or fail to reject the   null   hypothesis    H₀you formulated in   part   d)at   the   .05   significance   level.
g) Provide    a   verbal    interpretation    of   the    rejection    decision.
h) How   do   the   findings   from   the   two-sample   means   test   compare   to   the   findings   based   on   the   error   bar   graph   in   part   e)?(1-2   sentences)
i)          What    questions   do   these   findings    raise?Why   might   this   finding   come   about?(this   is,   of   course,somewhat   speculative.Please   limit   this   to   3   sentences).
Exercise   2 (10%of   mark)
Find   the   variables   cerd230c   and   grp_40.Familiarize   yourself   with   the   codebook   entries
for   both   of   these   variables,especially   the   missing   values.
a)Provide      frequency      tables      for      the      two      variables.If      someone      states"None"for   cerd230c   what   appears   to   happen   to   their   response   for   grp_40?
b)Run   a   t-test    investigating   the    effect   of   gender   on   grp_40   and    provide   the   output   before   you   recode   any   missing   variable.
c)Now run   a   t-test    investigating   the    effect   of   gender   on   grp_40   and    provide   the
output after   you recode any individuals who answer"None"for cerd230c to an interpretable   value on grp_40.(see the reading notes for more information about   this)
d)What is the difference in interpretation between these two t-tests?Which      one   seems   more   useful   in   this   case?(2-3   sentences)

Data
You   may   use   either the   GSS   or the   Canadian   Community   Health   Survey for this   assignment.
Exercise   1(20%of   mark)
You   may find the SPSS   DEMONSTRATION   13.2 at the   end   of Chapter   13   in   the   section"You   Are   the   Researcher"(p.447)useful      for      this      section.
Read   through   the   entire   directions   before   you   choose   variables.Note   that   you   will   need   to   make   a   causal   argument,and   one   of   your   interval-ratio   variables   will   be   a   dependent   variable   in   both   analyses.Using either   the   GSS   or   Canadian   Community   Health   Survey   Dataset,you   will   select   one   nominal   variable   that            has    more    than    two    categories(non-dichotomous)and    two      interval-ratio    variables.
a) Use   the   Descriptives   command   to   get   means   and   standard   deviation   for   two   interval   ratio   variables   Discuss   these   descriptive   findings   in   a   couple   of   sentences.(Hint:You   did   something   similar   back   on   Lab   A).Include   the   table   in   your   answer.
b) Use   the   Frequencies   command   to   get   the   frequency   tables   for   your   nominal   variable.Discuss   the
distribution   of   the   nominal   variable   and   write   a   couple   of   sentences   about   what   the   distribution   means   in   real-world   terms.(Hint:You   did   something   similar   back   on   Lab   A).Include   the   table   in   your   answer.
c) Transform. your   nominal variable into a new dichotomous variable,with"0"representing"No"and"1"               representing"Yes."Make   sure   this    new   variable    has    an   easy-to-remember    name!Then    create   a   two-way   frequency   table   for   your   old   nominal   variable   and   your   new   nominal   variable   to   make   sure   the
transformation    worked;include    the    table    in    your      answer.
Exercise      2(40%of      mark)
Examining   Theory:X=Nominal,Y=Interval/Ratio
a) Generate    a    causal    theory    about      your      nominal      variable      and      your      interval/ratio      variable.Which      one      is      likely      to   cause      the      other,and    why?Define       xand      y.[Note:this      should      be      approximately      two      sentences;one      to
explain   which   one   is   likely   to   cause   the   other,and   one   to   explain   why.If   you   are   having   trouble   coming   up   with    a    relatively    plausible    theory,you      may      want      to      select      different      variables]
b) Calculate      the       correlation       coefficient.Report       the       output       and       interpret       the       correlation       coefficient(one   sentence).
c) Run    the       OLS      regression.Report    the    output,and       interpret      the       regression      coefficient      and      intercept      (one   sentence    for    the      coefficient,one      for      the       intercept)
d) Interpret                R-Squared
e) Test   your   theory    using    all    six    steps    from    the    video    lecture    and    reading    notes.When    the      regression
output   gives   you   what   you    need,you    do    not    need    to    calculate    it    out    by    hand;simply    report    what    you   found    from    the      regression      output      above.
f) Based    on    the    tests      of      statistical      significance      and      measures      of      effect      size(correlation      coefficient,
regression      coefficient,and      R-squared),evaluate    your    theory.Do       not    write       more      than       3-4      sentences
Exercise   3(40%of   mark)
Examining   Theory:X=Interval/Ratio,Y=Interval/Ratio
a) Generate   a   causal   theory   about   your   two    interval/ratio   variables,using   the   same   dependent   variable      as   in   the   previous   section.Which   one   is   likely   to   cause   the   other,and   why?Define   xand   y.[Note:this   should   be   approximately   two   or   maybe   three   sentences;one   to   explain   which   one   is   likely   to   cause the   other,and   one   to   explain   why.If   you   are   having   trouble   coming   up   with   a   relatively   plausible theory,you   may   want   to   select   different   variables.]
b) Calculate    the    correlation    coefficient.Report      the      output      and      interpret      the      correlation      coefficient(one   sentence).
c) Run   the    OLS    regression.Report    the    output,and    interpret    the    regression    coefficient    and    intercept(ne   sentence   for   the   coefficient,one   for   the   intercept)
d) Interpret            R-Squared
e) Test   your   theory   using   all   six   steps   from   the   video   lecture   and   reading   notes.When   the   regression
output   gives   you   what   you   need,you   do   not   need   to   calculate   it   out   by   hand;simply   report   what   you   found   from   the   regression   output   above.
f)          Based   on   the   tests   of   statistical   significance   and   measures   of   effect   size(correlation   coefficient, regression   coefficient,and   R-squared),evaluate   your   theory.Do   not   write   more   than   3or   4   sentences.
